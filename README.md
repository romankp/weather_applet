# weather_web_app

A simple weather web app for Waltham, MA that uses the Open Weather Map API and allows users to search weather conditions in US cities.

The challenge was to use JSON and AJAX to create a quick, functional, dynamically updated application. This was also an early introduction to object-oriented JS and notation.

Extra CSS and a dash of jQuery were added for simplification and UI effects.
